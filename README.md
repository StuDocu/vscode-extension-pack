# Studocu Extension Pack

Repository for Studocu's recommended extensions for VSCode.
If we agree upon a new recommendation, you can add it here.

## How to add extensions?

1. Open `package.json`
2. Find the `extensionPack` key
3. Add the extension ID to the array

Little tip, to find the extension ID you can search your extension in [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
